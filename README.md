# arabidopsis-api-tair
A function which will make your access to tair datasets easier for the arabidopsis research. Run this function and it will run and download the arabidopsis datasets and make the required analysis. It will make all the dictionary with nested lists and tuples which will provide a easy access to the tair dataframe.  You dont have to go to tair website and check the gene conversion or the uniprot conversions, or the mapping or checking for the coordinates. This provides a nested dictionary with the nested list and tuples and you can simply search them. No need to make the SQL database as it downloads the file and then remove them after the search. This function is a part of the tairaccession package (pip install tairaccession), however you can use this separately.
